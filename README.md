# Why Cmder?
Rather than list my opinion of all the pros and cons of [Cmder](https://cmder.net/) and trying to sell you on using it. I will let the software speak for itself if you decide to use it. Simply put, I prefer using the full version of [Cmder](https://cmder.net/) bundled with [git-for-windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) because I find it to be robust, fast, and have *easy* access to the Windows filesystem. Cmder runs nativley, unlike [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (Windows Subsystem for Linux) which runs in a sandbox and makes access to the Windows file system convoluted. Allthough WSL is more robust for using *NIX style tools, I find that being confined to a Linux sandbox in the Windows environment for *__all__* my daily development tasks to be slower on the I\O side of things and somewhat defeats the purpose of using Windows 10 in the first place.

# Why not Powershell?
If you are working in the Windows environment then why use Unix style tools at all? Personally I find the [Powershell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell) syntax, learning curve and [encoding caveats](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40098771/changing-powershells-default-output-encoding-to-utf-8) a bit of a hurdle and just not as versatile as \*NIX tools. At times I do find myself working with Powershell in Cmder and I will say that the more I learn the better off I am because of it. I will be sharing what I have learned about Powershell here on this page and you will find some powershell scripts in the repository.
__TLDR;__ Powershell is awesome and can be integrated with Cmder. A well rounded scripter will be fluent in as many tools as possible.
# How to Use This Repository
It suggested that you perouse this document however you see fit. You may also download or copy and paste any portion of any of the files in this repository to fit your needs. Much of this document may be crafted for beginner and intermediate developers in the form of linear step lists, however I am sure that expert developers can probably gleam a few gems from this repository.

This repository is meant to be a relatively random compilation, a somewhat organized mishmosh if you will, of scripts, resources, learning materials, personal findings and revelations that may or may not be 'correct' or optimized but could easily help one learn alot and hopefully help ones workflow to solve some daily challenges that one may encounter.

Anyone that may have an opinion on how to do things better (optimize) or to add any resources to this repository please feel free to open pull requests anywhere you like.

      - TLDR pages give multiple usage examples of each \*NIX style command that the console supports.
  - __`sed`__: Stands for **S**tream **E**ditor. `sed` works with streams of characters for searching, filtering and text processing and despite its power, `sed` is considered a 'simpleton' when compared to `awk`. It is recommended to use `sed` for simple regex type operations and one-liners as `sed` syntax is more terse and compact than `awk` syntax. Complex multiline `sed` scripts can look noisy and be harder to read than `awk` programs.
    - [Probably the best `sed` guide out there](https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html)
    - Practice `sed` in real-time using a [`sed` REPL (sandbox) online editor](https://sed.js.org/).
    - The more formal [GNU `sed` documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/html_node/Regular-Expressions.html#Regular-Expressions).
  - __`awk`__: Is a text pattern scanning and processing language, which was created by **A**ho, **W**einberger & **K**ernighan. `awk` is mostly used for data extraction and reporting, was built around processing .csv files. `awk` is considered more robust than `sed`. `awk` can do everything that `sed` can do and much more since `awk` is essentially a full fledged programming language complete with system calls, and sophisticated constructs such as if/else, while, do/while, etc.
    - Practice `awk` in real-time using an [`awk` REPL (sandbox) online editor](https://awk.js.org/)
  - __`grep`__: Stands for **G**lobal **R**egular **E**xpression **P**rint and is used to search for specific terms in a file. Different from `awk` and `sed`, `grep` cannot add/modify/remove the text in a specific file. But itâ€™s useful when you just want to search and filter out matches.

    - [How to prevent grep from printing the same string multiple times](https://askubuntu.com/questions/681649/how-to-prevent-grep-from-printing-the-same-string-multiple-times)
  - __`tr`__: A command line utility for translating or deleting characters. Great for newline substitutions since `sed` is not designed for this and the `sed` syntax for translation involving the `\n` character is convoluted because it has a harder ro read escape sequence for the newline character. For example, if you wanted to output all the windows paths, each other their own line by replacing all instances of a semicolon with a `\n`, in `sed` it would look like much less readable: `path | sed -e $'s/,/\\\n/g'` than using `tr` to do the same thing: `path | tr ; '\n'`.
